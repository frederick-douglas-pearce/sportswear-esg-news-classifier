Important reminders:
- FIRST check if each brand refers to the sportswear company or something else (animal, region, car, etc.)
- If NOT a sportswear brand: set `is_sportswear_brand: false`, explain in `not_sportswear_reason`, leave `categories` empty
- If IS a sportswear brand: set `is_sportswear_brand: true`, `not_sportswear_reason: null`, fill in categories
- Only set `applies: true` if the article contains clear, relevant ESG information for that category
- Sentiment must be -1, 0, or 1 when applies is true; null when applies is false
- Evidence quotes MUST be exact text from the article
- If a sportswear brand has no substantive ESG content, omit it from brand_analyses entirely
